    "#Prompt Injection Optimization using Textual Gradients\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook attempts to use TextGrad to optimize an indirect prompt injection attack contained within NMAP scan results. To do this, the text prompt is taken and formatted similar to how it would be included as an SSH banner version within an NMAP scan, with the resulting simulated scan data being fed to an LLM using the same prompt as the attacking agent in the benchmarks. \n",
    "\n",
    "This exploration was not sucessful as the agent proves resistant to obvious prompt injection attacks which appear to diverge from its initial assignment; even with repeated feedback from GPT-4o, optimizing prompts attempting to dissuade the attacker fail. This indicates that evolutionary methods which sample a wider range of the space of prompt injections are a more suitable strategy."
